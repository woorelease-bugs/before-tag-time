# Test repo for [woorelease](https://github.com/woocommerce/woorelease)
Woorelease misses entries that were merged before **tag was created** - no but after the tagged commit/release.

1. Make a release `1.0.0` on commit _X_ without creating a tag, or delete the tag after the release.
2. Merge few PRs
3. (Re-)Create  the `1.0.0` on commit _X_

	```
	woorelease cl:generate --product_version=1.0.1 https://github.com/woorelease-bugs/before-tag-time/tree/develop
